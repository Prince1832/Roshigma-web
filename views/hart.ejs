          HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) is a communication
          protocol that allows different devices like sensors and transmitters,
          to communicate easily with each other adjust settings, and quickly
          resolve issues. It provides you with real-time data and better control
          over your processes and helps you to reduce downtime, fix
          troubleshooting and avoid costly disruptions. Understand the full
          potential of your product by partnering with Rhosigma and let’s

            The EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) allows a device to
            be described using a text like language. This is then compiled into
            an EDD file that is unique for each HART, FF, and Profibus network.
            The host system interprets the compiled EDD file and determines how
            a device appears in the applications. While the EDDL method is a
            simple way to describe the device, it is at the same time limited in
            the features it offers.
