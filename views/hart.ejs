            The EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) allows a device to
            be described using a text like language. This is then compiled into
            an EDD file that is unique for each HART, FF, and Profibus network.
            The host system interprets the compiled EDD file and determines how
            a device appears in the applications. While the EDDL method is a
            simple way to describe the device, it is at the same time limited in
            the features it offers.
